					<span class="imgBoxTitle"><p>Let's go six-digit income!</p></span>
					<p>After graduating college, it is time to look for jobs that would match my forte. This is a long-term plan and I will start at the very bottom.</p>
					<p>Join one company and another, continously gaining experience, learning new things in the industry as well as honing the skills that will benefit both myself and the company I will take part on.</p>

					<span class="imgBoxTitle"><p>Spoil the inner child</p></span>
					<p>What's better than to spoil yourself with things you never had when you were young.</p>
					<p>Own a house, travel to other places, have a cat, and so much more things that I want to experience in your life before I disappear.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="imgBox">
					<span class="imgBoxTitle"><p>Happy life and peaceful mind</p></span>
					<p>Living a life full of hapiness is a blessing I want to receive. I also want to give some back my parents, help those in need, and donate to an animal shelter.</p>
					<p>I want to live with a partner, no kids, just the two of us in a small house where we spend the rest of our lives together until we get old. </p>
